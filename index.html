        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Mahir, a third-year Computer Science student at Goldsmiths University, and I'm passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. As I enter my final year, I’m focused on honing my skills to become a well-rounded software engineer.

            My journey into the world of software development began with an interest in problem-solving. I love the challenge of breaking down complex issues and finding efficient solutions. Throughout my studies, I’ve gained hands-on experience in various programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and C++, and have worked on projects ranging from web applications to data analysis tools.
            
            I’m particularly drawn to building intuitive, user-friendly applications, and I’ve developed a deep interest in front-end development using frameworks like React.js. I also have experience working with databases and version control systems like Git, which I’ve found invaluable for collaboration and project management.
            
            Outside of my studies, I’m constantly exploring new technologies, contributing to open-source projects, and staying up-to-date with the latest trends in software development. My goal is to join a dynamic team where I can apply my skills, continue learning, and contribute to impactful projects.
            
            I’m excited for the next chapter in my career and eager to take on new challenges in the software engineering field.

                    <p><strong>Game Project</strong></p>
                </a>
                <p>This project showcases my skills in game development using <strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>HTML5 Canvas</strong>. I designed and built a simple yet engaging game, focusing on interactive elements and smooth user experience. The game mechanics were implemented with JavaScript, and I utilized the <strong>Canvas API</strong> to render the game environment, animations, and user interactions in real time. The game also features <strong>collision detection</strong> and <strong>score tracking</strong>. The project demonstrates my ability to create interactive web applications, manage game logic, and implement real-time updates, all within a user-friendly interface.</p>

                    <p><strong>Movie Review Website</strong></p>
                </a>
                <p>The Movie Review Website is a dynamic web application built using <strong>React.js</strong> for the front-end, and <strong>Node.js</strong> for the back-end. The website allows users to search for movies, view detailed information, and post reviews. I integrated an external <strong>Movie Database API</strong> to fetch movie data and display it in an organized format. The application features <strong>user authentication</strong> with <strong>JWT tokens</strong> for secure login and review posting. I used <strong>MongoDB</strong> to store user reviews and ratings. This project highlights my ability to build full-stack web applications, interact with APIs, and manage user data.</p>
